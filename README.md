# What is this
You might have come across an image with the following code in it:

```js
//life motto
if (sad() === true) {
    sad().stop()
    beAwesome()
}
```

This project aims to make complete working variants of the above code in different languages. 
The variants should contain the code above, verbatim, except where the syntax does not allow.

The code should print out [Barney's quote](https://youtu.be/Dc01V_mygzg?t=14s):

```
When I get sad,
stop being sad
and be awesome instead.
```

when run, each line from the `sad()`, `stop()` and `beAwesome()` functions (or their equivalents).

## Variants
